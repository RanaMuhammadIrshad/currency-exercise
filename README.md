## Create an array called myArr containing the following values: 5.99, 3.45
## Create a function addCurrency. 
The function will:
- add a € symbol after the array value (e.g 5.99€). 
- store the value into a new array.
- return the new array.

## Once you are done, create a new function called printPrices.
printPrices takes the returnArr as a parameter and dynamically prints out the following messages:
 - "price 1 is 5.99€"
 - "price 2 is 3.45€"


# BONUS
## Let's improve the implementation above by making sure that
- the user can pass either a "$" or a "€" as currency symbol ( "$" comes BEFORE the amount whereas the "€" comes at the end ).
